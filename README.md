## Description

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge, click the link above to visit the challenge page. 

## Built with 

<p>HTML<p>
<p>CSS<p>
<p>Flexbox<p>
<p>Vanilla JS<p>

## What I learnt 

I overcomplicated the Javascript file, I thought I needed to add lots of add class list lines when I could have just added them to a media query in my CSS, speaking of CSS I think this is the first time where I've used the relative and absolute positions.

Getting the share element pop-up on mobile to show correctly was way harder than I expected, got there eventually though!
